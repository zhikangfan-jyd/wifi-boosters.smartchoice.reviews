    <h1 class="title">How We Make Money</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>At Smart Choice, we take transparency seriously.</p>
      <p>Our content is free because we may earn a commission when you click on a link or make a purchase using our site. We want to make sure that you understand how we make money and who pays us, so we have taken measures to ensure that any advertiser we have a paid relationship with is labeled as "Our Partner" across our website. If you choose to click on the links on our site, we may receive compensation. If you don't click or use the phone numbers listed on our site, we will not be compensated. Ultimately, the choice is yours.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="title">How We Rank Our Partners</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Regardless of partner or compensation, we consider many additional factors, which are the result of the 200+ hours of research our Editorial Team spends on average to provide insights and recommendations for each category displayed on our website.</p>
      <p>Companies listed on our site must pass an initial quality screening. They must demonstrate integrity and fair dealing and have no recent history of serious legal and ethical issues.</p>
      <p>Companies that meet those threshold requirements are then reviewed by our Editorial Team. Our editors’ judgments are not influenced by bias, conflicts of interest, or financial considerations. We require our writers and editors to assess each company free from internal and external pressures.</p>
      <p>Additional elements that affect our ranking sometimes include historical data such as the number of consumer visits to a partner site, percentage of sign-ups and purchased services, the user device, operating system, location, the day of the week or time of day.</p>
      <p>Ranking, ratings, and the order of companies on our site are subject to change. Our partners' performance and/or payout may influence their position on our website, including the order in which they appear. For example, our partners sometimes get premium or additional placements on our website and in our marketing materials.</p>
      <p>The analyses and opinions on our site are our own and our editors and staff writers follow guidelines to ensure editorial integrity. Our brand, Smart Choice, stands for accuracy and helpful information. We know that we can only be successful if we take your trust in us seriously.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Our Research Process</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The first question we try to answer is "what's the difference"? We determine the main factors we think indicate quality in a given product or service and evaluate how the main competitors in an industry measure up to each. Once we have this data, we assign number values to each factor. Some factors carry more weight than others. This is subjective, so we give you insight into why we've determined the weights as we have.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Our team is committed to being the trusted source for honest, accurate, helpful and thorough reviews across a wide range of products and services.

        <li>2. The content on our site is original, reliable, and understandable. Our editors’ reviews are not influenced by bias, conflicts of interest, or financial considerations. We require our writers and editors to make independent judgments free from internal and external pressures.</li>
        <li>3. Despite making our best efforts to publish content that is accurate, there is a chance we may have missed some details, or that new information becomes available after publication. If we discover a mistake, our editors will promptly correct the information. Companies may also reach out to our Editorial Team periodically to request factual updates to our content, but our writers and editors ultimately reserve the right to publish this content on the basis of their Editorial Guidelines.</li>
        <li>4. Our Editorial Team is separate from our Marketing and Business Development teams. Our editorial reviews and opinions are in no way affected by our advertising partnerships.</li>
        <li>5. Our writers and editors may not accept compensation of any sort from individuals or entities who are featured or may be featured on our website. Companies may sometimes loan us products or extend their services free of charge to help make our Editorial Team’s job easier, but our judgments are made independently and not on the basis of these free products and services. Occasionally, we will keep a review unit for an extended period of time to fully evaluate it and over time. Acceptance does not constitute implied or actual endorsement.</li>
        <li>6. Our Editorial Teams is forbidden from accepting money or other considerations from individuals or entities as a condition or incentive to write any type of content on our site, whether favorable or unfavorable. However, our content is free because we may earn a commission when you click or make a purchase using our site. This content is all clearly and conspicuously disclosed.
